# 🔧 Environment Variable Fix Summary

## 🚨 **Issue Identified**

The workflow was failing because it couldn't find the `SUPABASE_URL` environment variable, even though you have all the required GitHub Secrets set.

## ✅ **Root Cause**

The workflow was trying to load environment variables from `backend/.env` file first, but that file doesn't exist in the GitHub Actions environment. The fallback to GitHub Secrets wasn't working properly.

## 🛠️ **Fixes Applied**

### **1. Fixed Environment Variable Loading**

**Before (Broken):**

```yaml
- name: Load environment variables
  run: |
    # Load environment variables from backend/.env (for local testing)
    if [ -f backend/.env ]; then
      export $(cat backend/.env | grep -v '^#' | xargs)
      echo "Environment variables loaded from backend/.env"
    else
      echo "backend/.env not found, using GitHub secrets"
    fi
```

**After (Fixed):**

```yaml
- name: Load environment variables
  run: |
    # In GitHub Actions, we use secrets directly, not .env files
    echo "🔧 Loading environment variables from GitHub Secrets..."

    # Set environment variables from GitHub Secrets
    echo "SUPABASE_URL=${{ secrets.SUPABASE_URL }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
    echo "SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=${{ secrets.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
    echo "GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY=${{ secrets.GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
    echo "EBAY_APP_ID=${{ secrets.EBAY_APP_ID }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
    echo "EBAY_CERT_ID=${{ secrets.EBAY_CERT_ID }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
```

### **2. Removed Redundant Environment Variables**

- Removed duplicate environment variable declarations from individual steps
- Now using global environment variables set at the workflow level

### **3. Added Verification**

- Added checks to verify that required environment variables are set
- Clear error messages if any required variables are missing

## 📋 **Files Modified**

- `.github/workflows/human-trafficking-scanner.yml` - Fixed environment loading
- `.github/workflows/enhanced-wildlife-scanner.yml` - Fixed environment loading

## 🚀 **Expected Results**

After these fixes:

- ✅ Environment variables load correctly from GitHub Secrets
- ✅ No more "SUPABASE_URL not set" errors
- ✅ Workflows can proceed to the scanning phase
- ✅ All required credentials are available to the scanning code

## 🔍 **How It Works Now**

1. **GitHub Secrets** are loaded directly into the workflow environment
2. **Verification** ensures all required variables are present
3. **Global scope** makes variables available to all steps
4. **Clear error messages** if anything is missing

## 📊 **Verification**

The workflow should now show:

```
🔧 Loading environment variables from GitHub Secrets...
✅ SUPABASE_URL is set
✅ SUPABASE_ANON_KEY is set
✅ GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY is set
✅ EBAY_APP_ID is set
✅ EBAY_CERT_ID is set
```

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Commit and push** the updated workflows
2. **Run the workflow** again in GitHub Actions
3. **Check the logs** for successful environment variable loading
4. **Verify** that the scan proceeds without credential errors

The environment variable issue has been resolved - your GitHub Secrets should now be properly loaded and available to the workflow!
