# 🔧 Dependency Fix Summary

## 🚨 **Issue Identified**

The GitHub Actions workflow was failing during dependency installation with this error:

```
ERROR: No matching distribution found for opencv-python==4.8.1
```

## ✅ **Root Cause**

The `opencv-python==4.8.1` version is not available for Python 3.11 in the GitHub Actions environment.

## 🛠️ **Fixes Applied**

### **1. Updated requirements.txt**

- Changed `opencv-python==4.8.1` → `opencv-python==4.8.0.76`
- Removed `asyncio` (built-in module, not needed)
- Removed `sqlite3` (built-in module, not needed)
- Added `fake-useragent` and `nltk` explicitly

### **2. Created requirements.github-actions.txt**

- More flexible version constraints using `>=` instead of `==`
- Better compatibility with GitHub Actions environment
- Fallback to strict versions if needed

### **3. Updated All Workflows**

- **Enhanced Wildlife Scanner**: Uses flexible requirements
- **Human Trafficking Scanner**: Uses flexible requirements
- **Test Enhanced System**: Uses flexible requirements

## 📋 **Files Modified**

- `requirements.txt` - Fixed version conflicts
- `requirements.github-actions.txt` - New flexible requirements file
- `.github/workflows/enhanced-wildlife-scanner.yml` - Updated dependency installation
- `.github/workflows/human-trafficking-scanner.yml` - Updated dependency installation
- `.github/workflows/test-enhanced-system.yml` - Updated dependency installation

## 🚀 **Expected Results**

After these fixes:

- ✅ Dependencies install successfully in GitHub Actions
- ✅ Workflows can proceed to the scanning phase
- ✅ JSON files should be created and uploaded as artifacts
- ✅ No more "No matching distribution found" errors

## 🔍 **Next Steps**

1. **Commit and push** the updated files
2. **Run the workflow** again in GitHub Actions
3. **Check the logs** for successful dependency installation
4. **Verify** that the scan proceeds to the next steps

## 📊 **Verification**

The workflow should now show:

```
✅ Installing dependencies with flexible versions...
✅ All packages installed successfully
✅ Playwright installed
✅ Environment variables loaded
✅ Scan completed successfully
✅ Files uploaded as artifacts
```

## 🎯 **If Issues Persist**

If you still see dependency errors:

1. Check the specific error message
2. The flexible requirements file should handle most version conflicts
3. We can further adjust versions as needed

The main blocker has been resolved - the workflow should now proceed past the dependency installation step!
